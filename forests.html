            <div><p>Rainforests are home to an unfathomable breadth of biodiversity — wildlife found nowhere else on Earth — from jaguars and gorillas to elephants and orangutans. They make the air we breathe and the water we drink. They provide livelihoods, food, shelter, and medicine for millions of people: local and Indigenous communities who have managed these forests for thousands of years. And rainforests are our best line of defense against climate chaos, storing massive amounts of carbon in their trees and in the ground — where it belongs.</p></div>

            <div><p>Rainforests are a global resource for all life on Earth. But their future — and ours — is in danger.While the largest remaining rainforests are on different continents, the threats they face are the same: Massive corporations are destroying tropical forests at an unprecedented rate, making huge profits off of deforestation and the human rights violations that too often go hand in hand with it. Lands are stolen from local and Indigenous communities and forests are destroyed for cheap commodities like palm oil, soy, cocoa, pulp and paper, timber, and beef — all for a quick profit.</p></div>
