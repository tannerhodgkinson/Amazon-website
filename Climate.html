                Burning fossil fuels, like coal,<br> oil, and gas, releases carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the air that 
                have been quickly warming up the surface of the Earth. For several<br> decades, climate change has been a global 
                crisis that will impact every single person and living being on this planet. Now, according to the latest UN <br>
                climate report, we have less than 10 years to cut global emissions in half. __</nobr></p></div>

            <div class= "stop"><nobr><p>To stop climate destruction in its tracks, carbon, and other greenhouse gas, emissions must be cut to zero, 
                and forests must remain standing <br> to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Forests protect the climate, 
                and reducing the impacts of a warming planet helps keep forests <br>standing. We can find our way out of this crisis 
                of survival, but we must demand that corporations defund climate change and keep forests<br> standing. Climate change 
                impacts don’t have to be something future generations deal with, we can change the course, get justice <br> for those 
                whose rights have been violated, and create a just and viable future.</nobr></p></div>
